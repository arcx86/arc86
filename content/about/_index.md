## Website

This is my personal website, a central location for everything I find interesting or relevant.

It's a hobby project and a learning experience, always under construction.\
It follows principles of minimalism and simplicity.\
I don't shy away from modern conventions and standards when working on this website. Therefore, despite it's appearance, backwards compatibility with legacy browsers is not a primary consideration and I can't guarantee functionality on them.

Previous versions can be explored on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20240305235331/https%3A%2F%2Fkinisis.xyz%2F).

### Tech Stack

This website is hosted on my home server running Nginx on a Debian virtual machine under Proxmox. The website has been built using Hugo.

## Me

I'm a hobbyist working in the IT industry who has been living on the internet since the early 2000s.

I have a range of interests. Technology & IT have always been my primary ones since very early childhood. I'm also a cinema (mainly what could be considered arthouse/experimental/otherwise interesting) enthusiast and anime (mostly pre-2010s) fan.
