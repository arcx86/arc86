## Goodbye, Kinisis

For 2025 I'm phasing out the "Kinisis" name and a lot of what comes with it.

This is a username I came up with spontaneously when registering for a website I can't even remember well over a decade ago. Originally a throwaway, I've reused it for several other sites until it stuck and became my de facto name. 

It has too long of a history and is associated with things which no longer represent me. Also I just don't like the sound of it anymore.

There are many advantages to decentralising your online footprint, not sharing an email or username across accounts and definitely not associating your entire online presence under one name (plus website!). Therefore it's time to follow my own advice.

## arc86

Originally a hostname used within my homelab, going forward all my online projects will now exist under this name which won't be directly associated with my other online accounts. Maybe in the future this new name won't only represent me personally.

This website can now be accessed at [https://arc86.net/](https://arc86.net/)
