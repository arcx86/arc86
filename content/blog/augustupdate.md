I'm still around, just haven't been updating the website recently.

Since my last blog post, I've been busy moving house, redecorating and dealing with everything else associated with such a change, which as you can imagine has kept me distracted.

Now that I'm more or less settled, I'm resuming work on this website, with a few changes and additions in progress.

I've recently switched my desktop OS to Fedora Linux, having slept on the Red Hat ecosystem for most of my time as a Linux user. This website is also now hosted on Rocky Linux (fully compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a successor to what CentOS used to be.)
